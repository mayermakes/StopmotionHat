# StopmotionHat
Files for the StopmotionHat  as seen on element14presents for use with Raspberry Pi 2-3+

This project aims to build a usable nearly pro grade alternative to expensive motion/timelapse rigs for independent filmmakers, students and enthusiasts
feel free to contribute observe and build. 

Depending on  reactions and developement I may get a future version of this into production, so non makers can use it without having to deal with the electronics of it.
